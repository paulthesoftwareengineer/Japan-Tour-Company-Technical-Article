In this article, we will create a simple D&D game using Python. This will be a text-based game, where players will input their actions through the command line.

Designing the Game

Before we start writing code, let's first design the basic structure of our game.

Our game will have the following features:

Players can create characters with a name, class, and hit points (HP).
Players can attack monsters and earn experience points (XP).
Players can level up and increase their HP when they gain enough XP.
The game will have a simple combat system where players roll a 20-sided die to determine the outcome of their attack.
With these features in mind, let's start designing our classes.

Creating the Character Class

We will start by creating a Character class to represent the players in our game. This class will have the following attributes:

name: the name of the character
char_class: the character's class (e.g. warrior, wizard, etc.)
hp: the character's hit points
xp: the character's experience points
The Character class will also have the following methods:

attack(): a method for the character to attack an enemy and potentially gain XP
level_up(): a method for the character to level up and increase their HP when they have gained enough XP
